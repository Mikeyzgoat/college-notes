**Week 1 Lecture: What is an Algorithm**

---

**Definition of an Algorithm:**
- An algorithm is a set of procedures to break a task and solve a well-specified problem.
- In professional settings, your role often involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, solvable tasks using computational techniques.

**Understanding the Problem:**
- Continuously ask questions to your manager or client to gain a deep understanding of the problem.
- Real-world problems are often described vaguely, requiring clarification and analysis.

**Communication and Vocabulary:**
- Develop a common vocabulary related to algorithm analysis to communicate effectively with peers and clients.
- Understanding and using this terminology is crucial for collaborative problem-solving.

**Practical Examples and Strategies:**
1. **Family Cooking Analogy:**
   - Solving a single-person problem vs. a family or restaurant scenario requires different levels of planning and synchronization.
   - Reflects how algorithm complexity and constraints change with the scale of the problem.

2. **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP):**
   - Visit multiple cities (e.g., Delhi, Kanpur, Kashi, etc.) with the goal of creating the shortest possible tour visiting each city once.
   - The nearest neighbor heuristic might not always yield the optimal solution.
   - Real-life application: optimizing travel routes with minimal distance.

3. **Sorting Problems:**
   - Simple sorting (e.g., red and blue balls) vs. complex sorting (e.g., diamonds of different sizes).
   - Different problems require varying levels of expertise and different algorithmic approaches.

**Why Algorithms Matter in Data Science:**
- Data scientists often need to analyze large datasets to extract meaningful insights and determine appropriate algorithms.
- Even if clients are not aware of technical requirements, data scientists must process and analyze the data to provide solutions.

**Brute Force Search Method:**
- Used when simpler heuristics like the nearest neighbor fail.
- Involves examining all possible permutations to find the optimal solution.
- Extremely time-consuming and computationally expensive for large datasets.

**Example: Permutations in TSP:**
- Calculating permutations can lead to a massive number of possible solutions.
- Example: 7 cities → 7! (5040 permutations); 50 cities → 50! (a huge number).

**Importance of Efficient Algorithms:**
- Solutions must be feasible within a reasonable time frame.
- NP-Hard problems, like TSP, require innovative approaches to find practical solutions.
- Inefficient algorithms (e.g., long payment processing times) render the solution impractical for real-world use.

**Conclusion:**
- Developing a strong understanding of algorithms and their analysis is crucial for problem-solving in data science and software engineering.
- This course aims to equip you with the necessary skills to tackle complex real-world problems effectively.

In this lecture, the focus is on understanding the complexities involved in solving real-world problems using algorithms, specifically illustrated through the traveling salesman problem (TSP) in the context of a grocery delivery app like Walmart or Flipkart.

### Key Points Discussed:

1. **Problem Context**:
    - The TSP involves finding the optimal route for a delivery person to visit multiple locations without revisiting any location.
    - The example given is of a grocery delivery app within IIT Guwahati campus, covering various locations like boys' hostels, faculty quarters, institute buildings, etc.

2. **Constraints Beyond Distance**:
    - **Time Slot Constraints**: Deliveries may need to consider operational hours of different buildings, e.g., faculty quarters in the morning, shops after they open, and hostels at specific times.
    - **Waiting Time**: The average time a recipient takes to receive a delivery can affect route planning. Historical data and data science can help predict these times.
    
3. **Real-life Example**:
    - In the morning, faculty quarters might be accessible, but institute buildings might not be operational, and shops might not be open. This requires scheduling based on availability rather than just proximity.

4. **Geodesic vs. Physical Distance**:
    - **Geodesic Distance**: The shortest path between two points on the Earth's surface, considering the curvature of the Earth.
    - **Physical Distance**: The actual travel path, which might be longer due to road layouts or flight paths.
    - An example is the route from Delhi to Kanpur, which might include detours through other towns, making the actual travel distance longer than the straight-line distance.

5. **Advanced Considerations**:
    - Algorithms need to account for non-linear and complex real-world conditions. 
    - **Riemannian Manifold**: Used to consider deviations from linear distances, applicable in complex geographical scenarios.

### Conclusion:

- Understanding and solving real-world problems using algorithms requires considering multiple constraints and real-world complexities.
- Factors like time slots, waiting times, and non-linear distances must be integrated into the algorithm design.
- Data science plays a crucial role in collecting and analyzing data to optimize these algorithms.

By applying these principles, you can develop more effective and efficient algorithms for practical applications, ensuring better performance and customer satisfaction.
