# CREATING-MATRICES

**Creating Matrices in R Programming**

**Introduction**

In this video, we learned about creating matrices in R programming, particularly in the context of data science. We will explore how to create matrices, including the importance of different arguments while creating a matrix.

**Creating Matrices**

To create a matrix in R, we use the `matrix()` function. This function takes several arguments, including the input data, the number of rows (`nrow`), the number of columns (`ncol`), and a logical argument `byrow` indicating whether to fill the matrix by row (default is column-wise).

**Example: Creating a Matrix**

```R
m <- matrix(1:20, nrow = 2, ncol = 10, byrow = TRUE)
```

In this example, we create a matrix `m` with 2 rows and 10 columns, filled by row (default is column-wise).

**Dimensions of a Matrix**

We can find the dimensions of a matrix using the `dim()` function. For example:

```R
dim(m)
```

This will return the dimensions of the matrix `m`, in this case, `c(2, 10)`.

**Number of Rows and Columns**

We can also find the number of rows and columns using `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions, respectively.

```R
nrow(m)  # returns 2
ncol(m)  # returns 10
```

**Number of Elements**

We can find the total number of elements in a matrix using the `length()` function.

```R
length(m)  # returns 20
```

**Converting Matrix to Vector**

We can convert a matrix to a vector using the `as.vector()` function.

```R
v <- as.vector(m)
```

**Reconstructing Matrix from Vector**

We can reconstruct a matrix from a vector using the `matrix()` function.

```R
v2 <- matrix(v, nrow = 2, ncol = 10)
```

**Matrix Data Types**

We can create matrices of different data types, such as numeric, integer, character, and logical. For example:

```R
m_numeric <- matrix(1:10, nrow = 2, ncol = 5)
m_integer <- matrix(1:10, nrow = 2, ncol = 5, dimnames = list(c("Row1", "Row2"), c("Col1", "Col2", "Col3", "Col4", "Col5")))
m_character <- matrix(c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e"), nrow = 2, ncol = 5)
m_logical <- matrix(TRUE, nrow = 2, ncol = 5)
```

**Checking Matrix Data Type**

We can check the data type of a matrix using the `is()` function.

```R
is.matrix(m_numeric)  # returns TRUE
is.integer(m_integer)  # returns TRUE
is.character(m_character)  # returns TRUE
is.logical(m_logical)  # returns TRUE
```

**Summary**

In this video, we learned how to create matrices in R programming, including the importance of different arguments while creating a matrix. We explored how to find the dimensions, number of rows and columns, and the number of elements in a matrix. We also learned how to convert a matrix to a vector and reconstruct a matrix from a vector. We discussed how to create matrices of different data types and how to check the data type of a matrix.

# COMBINE-OBJECTS

**Combining Objects in R**

**Introduction**

In this video, we will discuss how to combine objects in R, specifically focusing on combining vectors and matrices rowwise or columnwise using the `cbind` and `rbind` functions.

**Columnwise Combination**

One way to create a matrix in R is by combining two or more vectors rowwise or columnwise. For example, let's create a matrix by combining two vectors `x` and `y` using `cbind`. 

```
x <- c(5, 5, 5)
y <- c(11, 22, 33)
z <- cbind(x, y)
```

This will result in a matrix `z` of size 3x2.

**Rowwise Combination**

We can also combine vectors rowwise using `rbind`. For example:

```
x <- c(5, 5, 5)
y <- c(11, 22, 33)
z <- rbind(x, y)
```

This will result in a matrix `z` of size 2x3.

**Naming Rows and Columns**

When using `cbind` or `rbind`, we can automatically assign dimension names. For example:

```
par_age <- c(10, 20, 30)
par_height <- c(160, 170, 180)
z <- rbind(par_age, par_height, names = c("par_age", "par_height"))
```

This will result in a matrix `z` with the specified row names.

**Matrix Combination**

We can also combine matrices using `cbind` or `rbind`. For example:

```
x1 <- matrix(c(1, 2), nrow = 1, ncol = 2)
x2 <- matrix(c(1, 0, 1), nrow = 3, ncol = 1)
z <- cbind(x1, x2)
```

This will result in a matrix `z` of size 1x3.

**Conclusion**

In this video, we learned how to combine objects in R using `cbind` and `rbind`. We discussed columnwise and rowwise combination of vectors and matrices, and how to automatically assign dimension names. We also saw how to combine matrices using `cbind` or `rbind`.

# PLOTTING-MATRICES

Introduction
The video discusses plotting matrices in R and the various functions available for visualization, such as plot, matplot, image, contour, and filled.contour.

Plotting Matrices
- The plot function in R can be used to plot any two columns of a matrix, creating a 2D scatter plot. By default, it plots the first two columns of the matrix.
  Example: 
  x <- seq(0, 2*pi, length.out = 200)
  m <- cbind(sin(x), sin(x+pi))
  plot(m)

- The matplot function plots data matrix columnwise, with each column getting a different color and line type. This allows for easy comparison of multiple columns in a matrix.
  Example:
  matplot(m)

- The image function is used to plot two-dimensional data, displaying a matrix as an image. Customization options include changing axis labels and colors.
  Example:
  volcano <- volcano
  image(volcano)

- The contour function plots a series of contours in R, showing lines of equal values in the matrix. It is useful for visualizing the distribution of values in the matrix.
  Example:
  contour(volcano)

- The filled.contour function works similarly to contour plot but fills the area between two contours instead of drawing them as lines. This provides a clearer visualization of the distribution of values in the matrix.
  Example:
  filled.contour(volcano)

Summary
The video provides an overview of the different functions available for plotting matrices in R, including plot, matplot, image, contour, and filled.contour. Visualization of matrices is essential for understanding the data and can be customized to enhance the presentation of information.
