# CREATING-MATRICES

**Creating Matrices in R Programming**

**Introduction**

In this video, we learned about creating matrices in R programming, particularly in the context of data science. We will explore how to create matrices, including the importance of different arguments while creating a matrix.

**Creating Matrices**

To create a matrix in R, we use the `matrix()` function. This function takes several arguments, including the input data, the number of rows (`nrow`), the number of columns (`ncol`), and a logical argument `byrow` indicating whether to fill the matrix by row (default is column-wise).

**Example: Creating a Matrix**

```R
m <- matrix(1:20, nrow = 2, ncol = 10, byrow = TRUE)
```

In this example, we create a matrix `m` with 2 rows and 10 columns, filled by row (default is column-wise).

**Dimensions of a Matrix**

We can find the dimensions of a matrix using the `dim()` function. For example:

```R
dim(m)
```

This will return the dimensions of the matrix `m`, in this case, `c(2, 10)`.

**Number of Rows and Columns**

We can also find the number of rows and columns using `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions, respectively.

```R
nrow(m)  # returns 2
ncol(m)  # returns 10
```

**Number of Elements**

We can find the total number of elements in a matrix using the `length()` function.

```R
length(m)  # returns 20
```

**Converting Matrix to Vector**

We can convert a matrix to a vector using the `as.vector()` function.

```R
v <- as.vector(m)
```

**Reconstructing Matrix from Vector**

We can reconstruct a matrix from a vector using the `matrix()` function.

```R
v2 <- matrix(v, nrow = 2, ncol = 10)
```

**Matrix Data Types**

We can create matrices of different data types, such as numeric, integer, character, and logical. For example:

```R
m_numeric <- matrix(1:10, nrow = 2, ncol = 5)
m_integer <- matrix(1:10, nrow = 2, ncol = 5, dimnames = list(c("Row1", "Row2"), c("Col1", "Col2", "Col3", "Col4", "Col5")))
m_character <- matrix(c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e"), nrow = 2, ncol = 5)
m_logical <- matrix(TRUE, nrow = 2, ncol = 5)
```

**Checking Matrix Data Type**

We can check the data type of a matrix using the `is()` function.

```R
is.matrix(m_numeric)  # returns TRUE
is.integer(m_integer)  # returns TRUE
is.character(m_character)  # returns TRUE
is.logical(m_logical)  # returns TRUE
```

**Summary**

In this video, we learned how to create matrices in R programming, including the importance of different arguments while creating a matrix. We explored how to find the dimensions, number of rows and columns, and the number of elements in a matrix. We also learned how to convert a matrix to a vector and reconstruct a matrix from a vector. We discussed how to create matrices of different data types and how to check the data type of a matrix.

# MATRIX-FUNCTIONS

**Introduction:**

In this video, we will discuss matrix functions in R. We have previously covered some basic functions such as `dim()` for dimensions, `length()` for the total number of elements, and other similar functions. This video aims to explore more advanced functions applicable to matrices.

**Detailed Points:**

### Matrix Functions Overview

- Matrices are based on vectors, so functions that work on vectors can often be applied to matrices.
- Functions like `log()` can be used to perform element-wise operations on matrices.
- Logical operations can be performed to check conditions on all elements of a matrix.

### Examples of Matrix Functions

1. **Logarithmic Values:**
   - Use the `log()` function to compute the logarithmic value of all elements in a matrix.
     ```r
     log(m)
     ```

2. **Check Positive Elements:**
   - Use the `all()` function to check if all elements in the matrix are positive.
     ```r
     all(m > 0)
     ```

3. **Accessing and Modifying Elements:**
   - Access elements using their row and column indices. In R, indices start from 1.
     ```r
     m[1, 1]  # Access the element at the first row and first column
     ```
   - Modify elements by assigning new values to specific positions.
     ```r
     m[1, 3] <- 6  # Change the element at the first row and third column to 6
     ```

### Advanced Functions

1. **Head Function:**
   - The `head()` function can be used to view the top rows of a matrix.
     ```r
     head(m)    # Displays the entire matrix
     head(m, 1) # Displays the first row
     head(m, 2) # Displays the first two rows
     ```

2. **Summary Function:**
   - The `summary()` function provides column-wise statistics of the matrix.
     ```r
     summary(m)
     ```
   - The output includes the minimum value, first quartile, median, mean, third quartile, and maximum value for each column.

### Example Matrix Operations

- Given a matrix `m`:
  ```r
  m <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow=2, ncol=3)
  ```
- Compute the logarithm of each element:
  ```r
  log(m)
  ```
- Check if all elements are positive:
  ```r
  all(m > 0)
  ```
- Access and modify elements:
  ```r
  m[1, 1]  # Access the first element
  m[1, 3] <- 6  # Modify the element in the first row, third column to 6
  ```
- Use the `head()` function:
  ```r
  head(m)
  head(m, 1)
  head(m, 2)
  ```
- Use the `summary()` function:
  ```r
  summary(m)
  ```

**Summary:**

In this video, we explored various functions for working with matrices in R. We learned how to compute logarithmic values, check conditions, access and modify elements, and use advanced functions like `head()` and `summary()` for obtaining detailed matrix information. These functions enhance our ability to perform comprehensive operations and analyses on matrices in R. Further exploration of specialized functions will continue in upcoming videos and modules.

  Adding a scalar to a matrix adds the scalar to each element of the matrix:
  ```r
  x + 2
  ```
  Result:
  ```
  3 4
  5 6
  ```
- **Multiplication:**
  Multiplying a matrix by a scalar multiplies each element by the scalar:

  ```
  3 6
  9 12
  ```

### Matrix and Vector Operations
- **Multiplication:**
  A matrix can be multiplied by a vector if the dimensions align:
  ```r
  x <- matrix(1:4, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
  y <- c(5, 20)
  x * y
  ```
  Result:
  ```
  5 40
  15 80
  ```

### Matrix and Matrix Operations

# MATRIX-ATTRIBUTES

### Introduction

In this video, we explore various attributes of matrices in the R programming language. Understanding these attributes helps in manipulating and analyzing matrices effectively.

### Key Topics Discussed

1. **Matrix Attributes**
2. **Creating Matrices and Checking Attributes**
3. **Dimension Attribute**
4. **Class and Type of Matrices**
5. **Row and Column Names**
6. **Modifying Row and Column Names**

### Detailed Points

#### Matrix Attributes
- Similar to vectors, matrices in R have mandatory attributes like `class` and additional attributes such as `length` and `dimension`.
- The `attributes` function is used to check the attributes of a matrix.

#### Creating Matrices and Checking Attributes
- Example:
  ```r
  x <- matrix(NA, nrow = 2, ncol = 10)
  attributes(x)
  ```
  - This creates a matrix `x` filled with `NA` and displays its attributes.

#### Dimension Attribute
- Every matrix has a `dim` attribute that represents its dimensions.
- The `dim` function returns an integer vector of length 2, containing the number of rows and columns.
- Example:
  ```r
  dim(x)  # returns c(2, 10)
  ```

#### Class and Type of Matrices
- The `class` function tells the class of the matrix, and `typeof` tells the type of data.
- Example:
  ```r
  class(x)  # returns "matrix" "array"
  typeof(x) # returns "logical"
  ```

#### Row and Column Names
- Matrices, being two-dimensional, have row names (`rownames`) and column names (`colnames`).
- Example:
  ```r
  rownames(x) <- c("row1", "row2")
  colnames(x) <- c("col1", "col2", "col3", "col4", "col5", "col6", "col7", "col8", "col9", "col10")
  ```

#### Modifying Row and Column Names
- We can modify existing row and column names using the same functions.
- Example:
  ```r
  colnames(x)[2] <- "Coursera"
  ```

### Summary
In this video, we learned about the different attributes of matrices in R, including class, type, and dimensions. We also covered how to create matrices, check their attributes, and modify row and column names. These operations are fundamental for effective matrix manipulation and analysis in R.

# COMBINE-OBJECTS

**Combining Objects in R**

**Introduction**

In this video, we will discuss how to combine objects in R, specifically focusing on combining vectors and matrices rowwise or columnwise using the `cbind` and `rbind` functions.

**Columnwise Combination**

One way to create a matrix in R is by combining two or more vectors rowwise or columnwise. For example, let's create a matrix by combining two vectors `x` and `y` using `cbind`. 

```R
x <- c(5, 5, 5)
y <- c(11, 22, 33)
z <- cbind(x, y)
```

This will result in a matrix `z` of size 3x2.

**Rowwise Combination**

We can also combine vectors rowwise using `rbind`. For example:

```R
x <- c(5, 5, 5)
y <- c(11, 22, 33)
z <- rbind(x, y)
```

This will result in a matrix `z` of size 2x3.

**Naming Rows and Columns**

When using `cbind` or `rbind`, we can automatically assign dimension names. For example:

```R
par_age <- c(10, 20, 30)
par_height <- c(160, 170, 180)
z <- rbind(par_age, par_height, names = c("par_age", "par_height"))
```

This will result in a matrix `z` with the specified row names.

**Conclusion**

In this video, we learned how to combine objects in R using `cbind` and `rbind`. We discussed columnwise and rowwise combination of vectors and matrices, and how to automatically assign dimension names.

# SUBSETTING-MATRICES

## Subsetting Matrices in R

### Introduction
In this video, we explore how to subset matrices in R. This includes creating matrices, extracting elements by indices, and using logical vectors for subsetting. 

### Matrix Representation
- A matrix is a two-dimensional array with elements identified by row and column indices, e.g., `x[1,1]`, `x[2,3]`.
- Indices start from one.

### Creating a Matrix
- Matrices in R can be created using the `sprintf` command for easy visualization:
  ```R
  matrix(sprintf("x[%d,%d]", rep(1:3, each = 4), 1:4), 3, 4)
  ```
  This creates a 3x4 matrix with elements labeled by their indices.

### Subsetting by Index
- Extracting a single element:
  ```R
  x[3,1]
  ```
  Retrieves the element in Row 3, Column 1.
  
- Column-wise extraction using a single index:
  ```R
  x[8]
  ```
  Retrieves the 8th element in a column-wise order.

### Extracting Multiple Elements
- Extracting multiple rows or columns:
  ```R
  matrix <- matrix(101:112, nrow = 4, ncol = 3)
  matrix[c(4, 2), 2]
  matrix[1, 1:3]
  matrix[c(2, 3), 1:2]
  ```

### Extracting Entire Rows or Columns
- Extracting entire first row:
  ```R
  matrix[1, ]
  ```
- Extracting entire third column:
  ```R
  matrix[, 3]
  ```

### Subsetting with Row and Column Names
- Creating a matrix with named rows and columns:
  ```R
  colnames(matrix) <- c("Gold", "Silver", "Bronze")
  rownames(matrix) <- c("USA", "Canada", "England")
  ```
- Accessing elements using names:
  ```R
  matrix["Canada", "Gold"]
  ```

### Logical Subsetting
- Using logical vectors to subset:
  ```R
  matrix[matrix[, "Gold"] > 2, ]
  ```

### Search and Replace
- Replacing elements based on a condition:
  ```R
  x[x > 0.5] <- 999
  ```

### Error Handling in Subsetting
- Accessing non-existent elements results in an error:
  ```R
  x[5, 5]
  ```

### Summary Table of Methods
- A table summarizing different subsetting methods can be helpful.

### Sorting Matrices
- Sorting specific columns or rows:
  ```R
  sort(matrix[, "Gold"])
  ```
- Using `order` function for ordering:
  ```R
  student <- matrix(c("John", 3, "Doe", 2, "Smith", 1), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
  student[order(student[, 2]), ]
  ```

### Conclusion
Subsetting matrices in R is a powerful technique for data analysis. It allows for efficient data extraction, modification, and sorting. Practice the methods discussed to become proficient in matrix operations.

In the next video, we will explore plotting matrices in R.

# PLOTTING-MATRICES

### Introduction

In this video, we discuss various functions available in R for plotting matrices, which is essential for data visualization. These functions allow you to create different types of plots to better understand and interpret your data.

### Key Topics Discussed

1. **Plotting Functions Overview**
2. **Using the `plot` Function**
3. **Using the `matplot` Function**
4. **Using the `image` Function**
5. **Using the `contour` Function**
6. **Using the `filled.contour` Function**

### Detailed Points

#### Plotting Functions Overview

R provides several functions for plotting matrices:
- `plot`: A generic X-Y plot.
- `matplot`: Plots columns of a matrix.
- `image`: Displays a matrix as an image.
- `contour`: Creates a 2D contour plot.
- `filled.contour`: Creates level plots.

#### Using the `plot` Function

The `plot` function in R can plot any two columns of a matrix, creating a 2D scatter plot. If not specified, it defaults to the first two columns.

Example:
```r
x <- seq(0, 2 * pi, length.out = 200)
m <- cbind(sin(x), sin(x + pi))
plot(m)
```
In this example:
- `x` is a vector of 200 values.
- `m` is a matrix with 200 rows and 2 columns.
- The `plot` function creates a scatter plot of the first two columns of `m`.

#### Using the `matplot` Function

The `matplot` function plots data matrix column-wise, assigning each column a different color and line type.

Example:
```r
matplot(x, m, type = 'l', col = 1:2, lty = 1:2)
legend('topright', legend = c('sin(x)', 'sin(x + pi)'), col = 1:2, lty = 1:2)
```
In this example:
- Columns of `m` are plotted with different colors and line types.
- A legend is added for clarity.

#### Using the `image` Function

The `image` function plots matrix data as an image. It is useful for visualizing two-dimensional data.

Example:
```r
image(volcano, col = terrain.colors(100))
```
In this example:
- The built-in `volcano` dataset is used.
- The `image` function displays the matrix as an image with a customized color palette.

#### Using the `contour` Function

The `contour` function creates contour plots, which are useful for visualizing three-dimensional data in two dimensions.

Example:
```r
contour(volcano)
```
In this example:
- The `contour` function plots the `volcano` dataset, displaying lines of equal value.

#### Using the `filled.contour` Function

The `filled.contour` function works similarly to `contour`, but it fills the areas between contours with colors.

Example:
```r
filled.contour(volcano, color.palette = terrain.colors)
```
In this example:
- The `filled.contour` function creates a filled contour plot of the `volcano` dataset.

### Summary

In this video, we explored different R functions for plotting matrices, including `plot`, `matplot`, `image`, `contour`, and `filled.contour`. These functions are powerful tools for visualizing data, helping to understand and interpret the information within matrices. Experimenting with these functions and their customization options can enhance your data visualization skills in R.
