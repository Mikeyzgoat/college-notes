# WHAT-IS-DATA-STRUCTURE

Data Structure and Algorithm

Introduction:
Data structure is a way of organizing data with associated set of operations, which can be applied on them, implemented using well-defined algorithms.

What is a Data Structure?
A data structure is a combination of how the data elements are arranged, what are the operations that you can perform on the arrangement, and what are the algorithms for performing each of the operations.

Types of Data Structures:
There are various types of data structures, such as:

* Random Access: This type of data structure allows for random access to any element in the collection.
* Last-In-First-Out (LIFO): This type of data structure allows for insertion and removal of elements from the end of the collection.
* First-In-First-Out (FIFO): This type of data structure allows for insertion and removal of elements from the beginning of the collection.
* Hierarchical: This type of data structure allows for arranging elements in a hierarchical manner.
* Network: This type of data structure allows for arranging elements in a network manner.

Algorithms:
Algorithms are well-defined, unambiguous sequences of sub-operations to perform a target task. They are used to implement data structures and perform operations on them.

Example:
To illustrate the concept of data structures and algorithms, let's consider an example of arranging books in a collection. In this example, we can use different data structures, such as linear, hierarchical, and network, to organize the books. Each data structure has its own set of operations, such as insertion and removal, which are implemented using algorithms.

Code Snippet:
Here is a Python code snippet that demonstrates the concept of data structures and algorithms:
```
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title):
        self.title = title

class BookCollection:
    def __init__(self):
        self.books = []

    def add_book(self, book):
        self.books.append(book)

    def remove_book(self, book):
        self.books.remove(book)

    def display_books(self):
        for book in self.books:
            print(book.title)

# Create a book collection
collection = BookCollection()

# Add books to the collection
book1 = Book("Book1")
book2 = Book("Book2")
book3 = Book("Book3")
collection.add_book(book1)
collection.add_book(book2)
collection.add_book(book3)

# Display the books in the collection
collection.display_books()

# Remove a book from the collection
collection.remove_book(book2)

# Display the books in the collection again
collection.display_books()
```
In this code snippet, we define a `Book` class and a `BookCollection` class. The `Book` class has a `title` attribute, and the `BookCollection` class has methods for adding and removing books, as well as displaying the books in the collection. The code demonstrates the concept of data structures and algorithms by creating a book collection and performing operations on it.

Summary:
In this note, we discussed the concept of data structures and algorithms. We defined what a data structure is and discussed different types of data structures, such as random access, last-in-first-out, first-in-first-out, hierarchical, and network. We also discussed the concept of algorithms and how they are used to implement data structures and perform operations on them. We used a Python code snippet to demonstrate the concept of data structures and algorithms by creating a book collection and performing operations on it.

# WHAT-IS-A-PROGRAM

**Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms**

A program is a set of instructions that a computer can execute to solve a problem. It consists of two main components: data structure and algorithm. Data structure is a way to organize and store data in a computer, while an algorithm is a set of steps to solve a problem. In this lecture, we will discuss the relationship between data structure and algorithm, and how they are used to solve real-world problems.

**Data Structure**

A data structure is a way to organize and store data in a computer. It is used to store and manage data in a program. There are different types of data structures, including primitive data structures and non-primitive data structures. Primitive data structures are used to store a single value, such as an integer or a character, while non-primitive data structures are used to store multiple values.

Example: Consider a program that needs to store the factorial of a given integer. The program can use a primitive data structure, such as a variable, to store the value of the factorial.

**Algorithm**

An algorithm is a set of instructions that a computer can execute to solve a problem. It is a step-by-step procedure that takes some input, processes it, and produces some output. Algorithms are used to solve problems in computer science, and they are an essential part of programming.

Example: Consider a program that needs to find the factorial of a given integer. The program can use an algorithm that iterates from the given integer down to 1, multiplying each number by the previous result.

**Relationship between Data Structure and Algorithm**

A program consists of both data structure and algorithm. The data structure is used to store and manage the data, while the algorithm is used to solve the problem. The choice of data structure and algorithm depends on the problem being solved.

Example: Consider a program that needs to find an element in a collection of integers. The program can use an array data structure to store the integers, and an algorithm that iterates through the array to find the element.

**Summary**

In conclusion, a program consists of both data structure and algorithm. Data structure is used to store and manage the data, while algorithm is used to solve the problem. The choice of data structure and algorithm depends on the problem being solved. By combining data structure and algorithm, we can solve complex problems and create efficient programs.

**Data, Data Element, and Data Type**

In computer science, data refers to a collection of raw facts. Examples of data include a collection of integer numbers, a collection of cities, or a collection of students' records. Each component of the data is called a data element. Data elements are logical units that constitute the data.

For instance, in a collection of integer numbers, each integer number is a data element. Data elements together form a collection of elements, which is the data. Each data element has a specified data type. In the example of a collection of integer numbers, the data type is integer.

**Data Type**

Data types define the characteristics of a data element. There are two types of data types: primitive data types and non-primitive data types. Primitive data types, such as integers and characters, are built-in data types provided by the programming language. Non-primitive data types, such as structures and arrays, are user-defined data types.

**Storage Structure of Data Collection in Memory**

Data structures defined in a program are stored in computer memory. There are two types of memory: primary memory (RAM) and secondary memory (hard disk). RAM is volatile memory, where information is stored temporarily. Secondary memory is non-volatile memory, where information is stored permanently.

**Contiguous Memory Allocation**

Contiguous memory allocation is a method of storing data elements in contiguous memory locations. In this method, data elements are stored at contiguous memory locations. For example, consider a collection of characters and a collection of integers. Each character or integer is stored in a contiguous memory location.

**Non-Contiguous Memory Allocation**

Non-contiguous memory allocation is a method of storing data elements in non-contiguous memory locations. In this method, data elements are stored at arbitrary memory locations. For example, consider a collection of elements a, b, c, d, and e. These elements can be arranged in a linear or non-linear order.

**Advantages and Disadvantages of Contiguous Memory Allocation**

Advantages:

* Order the elements in linear fashion
* Supports random access memory
* No additional memory is required for storing the address of other elements

Disadvantages:

* Static allocation
* Operating system may experience defragmentation of memory
* Unused memory space may be left unused

**Advantages and Disadvantages of Non-Contiguous Memory Allocation**

Advantages:

* Dynamic memory allocation
* Allows growing and shrinking the size of the data in runtime

Disadvantages:

* Additional memory is needed to store the address of other data elements
* High storage requirement
* Data access may be slower due to the need to traverse through other data elements to get the address of the target elements

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, data is a collection of raw facts, and data elements are logical units that constitute the data. Data types define the characteristics of a data element. Contiguous memory allocation stores data elements in contiguous memory locations, while non-contiguous memory allocation stores data elements in non-contiguous memory locations. Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages.

Data Structures Operations

Data structures operations are the standard set of operations that can be performed on data structures. These operations include:

* Creation: Creating an empty instance of a data structure.
* Insertion: Inserting an element into an instance of a data structure.
* Deletion: Deleting an element from a data structure.
* Updation: Updating the value of a data element.
* Searching: Searching for an existence or non-existence of a data element.
* Traversal: Visiting every data element in a data structure.
* Sorting: Ordering the data elements in ascending or descending order.
* Merging: Merging data elements of two or more data structures.

Algorithm Properties

An algorithm is a well-defined list of finite and unambiguous steps for solving a problem. It has five properties:

* Input specified: The input to an algorithm should be clearly defined.
* Output specified: The output of an algorithm should be clearly specified.
* Definiteness: Every step of an algorithm should be defined unambiguously.
* Finiteness: Every algorithm should terminate after a finite number of steps.
* Effectiveness: The steps of an algorithm should be sufficiently basic and doable by a person in a specified time with pen and pencil.

Algorithm Complexity

Algorithm complexity defines the amount of time and space required to solve a problem. It is defined in terms of time complexity and space complexity. Time complexity defines the amount of time an algorithm will take to execute, while space complexity defines the amount of space an algorithm will require to solve the problem.

Types of Data Structures

Data structures can be classified into:

* Primitive data structures: These are generally those data types which can store single elements.
* Non-primitive data structures: These are those data structures that cannot store single elements.
* Linear data structures: These are those data structures where the elements are arranged in a linear order.
* Non-linear data structures: These are those data structures where the elements are arranged in a non-linear order.
* Homogeneous data structures: These are those data structures where every data element is defined by a single value data.
* Heterogeneous data structures: These are those data structures where data elements can have more than one data element.
* Static data structures: These are those data structures that do not allow you to change the size of its storage in runtime.
* Dynamic data structures: These are those data structures that allow you to change the size of its storage in runtime.

Common Data Structures

Some common data structures include:

* Arrays
* Linked lists
* Stacks
* Queues
* Trees or binary trees
* Hash
* Graphs

# ARRAY

**Introduction to Arrays**

An array is a collection of finite numbers of homogeneous data elements stored at contiguous memory locations. It is a linear data structure, meaning the elements are arranged in a linear sequence. Each element in the array is identified by an index, which defines the location and ordering of the data elements.

**Array Definition**

An array is defined as a collection of homogeneous data elements stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in the array should be of the same data type, such as integers, floats, or characters. The array is a linear data structure, meaning the elements are arranged in a linear sequence.

**Array Examples**

Example 1: One-Dimensional Array
```
array = [5, 7, 2]
```
Example 2: Two-Dimensional Array
```
array = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
```
Example 3: Three-Dimensional Array
```
array = [[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]]
```
**Array Properties**

1. **Random Access**: An array allows random access to its elements. This means that any element in the array can be accessed directly without having to access other elements.
2. **Homogeneous**: All elements in an array should be of the same data type.
3. **Contiguous Memory Location**: Elements in an array are stored at contiguous memory locations.
4. **Linear Data Structure**: Elements in an array are arranged in a linear sequence.

**Array Types**

1. **One-Dimensional Array**: An array with one dimension, where each element is identified by an index.
2. **Two-Dimensional Array**: An array with two dimensions, where each element is identified by a row and column index.
3. **Three-Dimensional Array**: An array with three dimensions, where each element is identified by a plate, row, and column index.

**Accessing Array Elements**

1. **One-Dimensional Array**: An element in a one-dimensional array can be accessed using its index, for example, `array[0]`.
2. **Two-Dimensional Array**: An element in a two-dimensional array can be accessed using its row and column index, for example, `array[1][2]`.
3. **Three-Dimensional Array**: An element in a three-dimensional array can be accessed using its plate, row, and column index, for example, `array[1][2][3]`.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, arrays are a fundamental data structure in programming, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of data. Understanding the properties and types of arrays is crucial for effective use in programming.

# REPRESENTATION-OF-ARRAY-IN-MEMORY

**Memory Representation of Arrays**

**Introduction**

Arrays are a fundamental data structure in programming, and understanding how they are represented in memory is crucial for efficient programming. In this note, we will explore how arrays are represented in memory, including the concepts of base address, effective address, and memory layout.

**One-Dimensional Array**

A one-dimensional array is a linear arrangement of elements, where each element is stored in consecutive memory locations. The base address of an array is the starting address of the array in memory. The effective address of an element in the array is calculated by adding the base address to the product of the index of the element and the size of the element.

**Example**

Suppose we have a one-dimensional array of integers with 5 elements, where each element is 2 bytes long. The base address of the array is 1000. The effective address of the first element is 1000, the effective address of the second element is 1002, and so on.

**Two-Dimensional Array**

A two-dimensional array is a collection of one-dimensional arrays, where each element is stored in consecutive memory locations. The base address of a two-dimensional array is the starting address of the array in memory. The effective address of an element in the array is calculated by adding the base address to the product of the row index, column index, and size of the element.

**Example**

Suppose we have a two-dimensional array of integers with 3 rows and 4 columns, where each element is 2 bytes long. The base address of the array is 1000. The effective address of the element at row 1, column 3 is 1018.

**Three-Dimensional Array**

A three-dimensional array is a collection of two-dimensional arrays, where each element is stored in consecutive memory locations. The base address of a three-dimensional array is the starting address of the array in memory. The effective address of an element in the array is calculated by adding the base address to the product of the row index, column index, and size of the element.

**Example**

Suppose we have a three-dimensional array of integers with 2 rows, 3 columns, and 4 plates, where each element is 2 bytes long. The base address of the array is 1000. The effective address of the element at row 1, column 2, plate 3 is 1062.

**n-Dimensional Array**

A generalization of the above concepts can be applied to n-dimensional arrays, where each element is stored in consecutive memory locations. The base address of an n-dimensional array is the starting address of the array in memory. The effective address of an element in the array is calculated by adding the base address to the product of the indices of the element and the size of the element.

**Summary**

In conclusion, arrays are a fundamental data structure in programming, and understanding how they are represented in memory is crucial for efficient programming. We have explored the concepts of base address, effective address, and memory layout of one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional arrays. By applying these concepts to n-dimensional arrays, we can generalize the memory representation of arrays to any dimension.

# ABSTRACT-DATA-TYPE-ADT

**Abstract Data Type (ADT) Notes**

**Introduction**

An Abstract Data Type (ADT) is a way of separating the implementation of a data structure from its use. It allows developers to create a data structure without worrying about the internal implementation, allowing for easier maintenance and modification.

**Key Concepts**

* Implementer: The person who creates the ADT.
* Client: The person who uses the ADT.
* Data Encapsulation: The idea of putting the storage data and the set of functions or operations that can be performed on the data together as a single unit.
* Data Hiding: The idea of hiding the characteristics of the data defined in the private member from the application program.
* Inheritance: The ability of one ADT to inherit another ADT.

**Properties of ADT**

* Encapsulation: Data encapsulation is one of the core properties of ADT.
* Data Hiding: The private members are hidden from the application programmer.
* Inheritance: One ADT can inherit another ADT.

**Advantages of ADT**

* Client uses ADT without knowing anything about the internal implementation.
* Implementer can update the ADT without affecting the client program.

**Example**

```python
class Array:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.size = size
        self.data = [None] * size

    def insert(self, index, value):
        self.data[index] = value

    def print_data(self):
        for value in self.data:
            print(value)
```

This example shows how an ADT for an array can be defined, including methods for inserting and printing data.

**Summary**

In conclusion, ADT is a powerful tool for separating the implementation of a data structure from its use. It allows developers to create a data structure without worrying about the internal implementation, allowing for easier maintenance and modification. The ADT properties of encapsulation, data hiding, and inheritance make it a flexible and powerful tool for developers.
