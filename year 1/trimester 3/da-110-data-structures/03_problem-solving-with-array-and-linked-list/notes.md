# SPACE-COMPLEXITY-OF-ITERATIVE-FUNCTIONS

**Space Complexity**

**Introduction**

The concept of space complexity is essential in understanding how a process uses memory during its execution. In this section, we will discuss the space complexity of individual operations and how to estimate it.

**Understanding Memory Allocation**

A process is a program in execution, and when a process is created by the operating system, a chunk of memory is allocated to the process. This chunk is divided into four sections: text or code, data, heap, and stack.

* Text or code section: stores the executable code of the program
* Data section: stores global variables defined in the program
* Heap: stores dynamically allocated memory during the execution of the program
* Stack: stores activation records of active functions

**Activation Record**

An activation record is a data structure that contains all the local variables or parameters of a function, the return address to the calling function, and the content of the CPU registers.

**Memory Allocation Example**

Using an example of a factorial function, we can illustrate the memory allocation process. The program consists of four sections: text, data, heap, and stack.

* Text section: stores the executable code of the program
* Data section: stores global variables
* Heap: stores dynamically allocated memory
* Stack: stores activation records of active functions

**Execution of the Program**

The execution of the program is sequential, starting from the main function. When the main function is called, its activation record is pushed onto the stack. Then, when the factorial function is called, its activation record is also pushed onto the stack. The stack grows as more functions are called, and it shrinks when functions return.

**Space Complexity**

Space complexity is defined by the rate of growth of space in the process space, defined by the size of the stack, heap, and data. It measures how the space consumption of the process grows with respect to the input size.

**Example Analysis**

In the factorial example, the size of the activation records is constant, and the size of the heap and data segments are also constant, independent of n. Therefore, the space complexity of the program and the factorial function are both O(1).

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, understanding space complexity is crucial in understanding how a process uses memory during its execution. By analyzing the memory allocation process and the execution of a program, we can estimate the space complexity of individual operations.

# SPACE-COMPLEXITY-OF-OPERATIONS-ON-ARRAY-AND-LINKED-LIST

**Space Complexity of Array Operations**

**Introduction**

In this section, we will discuss the space complexity of array operations. We will explore the concept of space complexity, its definition, and how it is calculated. We will also examine the space complexity of different array operations, including creation, insertion, deletion, and traversal.

**Defining Space Complexity**

Space complexity is a measure of the amount of memory required by an algorithm. It is typically measured in terms of the number of variables used by the algorithm. In the context of array operations, space complexity refers to the amount of memory required to store the array elements.

**Space Complexity of Creation Operation**

The creation operation involves allocating memory for the array. The space complexity of the creation operation is O(n), where n is the size of the array. This is because the memory required to store the array elements increases linearly with the size of the array.

**Space Complexity of Insertion Operation**

The insertion operation involves inserting a new element into the array. The space complexity of the insertion operation is O(1), because only a constant amount of memory is required to store the new element.

**Space Complexity of Deletion Operation**

The deletion operation involves removing an element from the array. The space complexity of the deletion operation is O(1), because only a constant amount of memory is required to remove the element.

**Space Complexity of Traversal Operation**

The traversal operation involves iterating over the array elements. The space complexity of the traversal operation is O(n), because the memory required to store the array elements increases linearly with the size of the array.

**Space Complexity of Update Operation**

The update operation involves updating an element in the array. The space complexity of the update operation is O(1), because only a constant amount of memory is required to update the element.

**Space Complexity of Link List Operations**

The space complexity of link list operations, such as creation, insertion, deletion, and traversal, is similar to that of array operations. The main difference is that link lists do not support random access, which affects the time complexity of the operations.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the space complexity of array operations is an important concept in computer science. It is a measure of the amount of memory required by an algorithm and is typically measured in terms of the number of variables used by the algorithm. The space complexity of different array operations, including creation, insertion, deletion, and traversal, is O(n), O(1), O(1), and O(n), respectively.

# BINARY-SEARCH

**Binary Search**

**Introduction**

Binary search is a search algorithm that finds an element in a sorted array or linked list. It is an efficient algorithm that reduces the search space by half in each step, resulting in a time complexity of O(log n).

**How Binary Search Works**

Binary search works by dividing the search space into two halves and selecting the middle element as the pivot. If the pivot is the target element, the algorithm returns the element. If the pivot is less than the target element, the algorithm repeats the process with the right half of the array. If the pivot is greater than the target element, the algorithm repeats the process with the left half of the array.

**Example**

Suppose we have a sorted array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] and we want to find the element 5.

1. Divide the array into two halves: [1, 2, 3] and [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
2. Select the middle element 3 as the pivot.
3. Since 5 is greater than 3, repeat the process with the right half of the array.
4. Divide the right half into two halves: [4, 5] and [6, 7, 8, 9]
5. Select the middle element 5 as the pivot.
6. Since 5 is the target element, the algorithm returns the element 5.

**Time Complexity**

The time complexity of binary search is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because the algorithm reduces the search space by half in each step.

**Space Complexity**

The space complexity of binary search is O(1) for iterative algorithms and O(log n) for recursive algorithms.

**Comparison with Linear Search**

Binary search is more efficient than linear search for large datasets. While linear search has a time complexity of O(n), binary search has a time complexity of O(log n).

**Limitations**

Binary search requires the array or linked list to be sorted. If the array or linked list is not sorted, the algorithm will not work correctly.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, binary search is a fast and efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array or linked list. It reduces the search space by half in each step, resulting in a time complexity of O(log n).

# REVERSING-ELEMENTS-IN-ARRAY-AND-LINKED-LIST

**Reversing Arrays and Linked Lists**

**Introduction**

In this session, we will explore the problem of reversing arrays and linked lists. We will discuss the iterative and recursive approaches to solve this problem.

**Reversing an Array**

The problem is to reverse the elements in an array without using an additional array. We can solve this problem using an iterative approach. The algorithm works by scanning the array from both ends simultaneously and exchanging the elements.

**Iterative Approach**

Here is a Python code snippet illustrating the iterative approach:
```python
def reverse_array(arr):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return arr
```
**Time and Space Complexity**

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the array. The space complexity is O(1) since we only use a constant amount of space to store the indices.

**Reversing a Linked List**

The problem is to reverse the nodes in a linked list without creating a new linked list. We can solve this problem using an iterative approach. The algorithm works by maintaining three pointers: previous, current, and next. We update these pointers as we traverse the linked list.

Here is a Python code snippet illustrating the iterative approach:
```python
def reverse_linked_list(head):
    prev = None
    curr = head
    while curr:
        next_node = curr.next
        curr.next = prev
        prev = curr
        curr = next_node
    return prev
```
**Time and Space Complexity**

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the linked list. The space complexity is O(1) since we only use a constant amount of space to store the pointers.

**Conclusion**

In this session, we discussed the problem of reversing arrays and linked lists. We explored the iterative and recursive approaches to solve these problems. We also discussed the time and space complexity of these algorithms.
