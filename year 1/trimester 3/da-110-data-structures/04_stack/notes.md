# WHAT-IS-STACK-AND-WHAT-ARE-ITS-OPERATIONS

**Stack Data Structure**

A stack is a linear and homogeneous data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) or First-In-Last-Out (FILO) principle. It is a linear data structure that allows the insertion and removal of elements from one end, known as the top.

**Key Features**

* Linear and homogeneous data structure
* Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) or First-In-Last-Out (FILO) principle
* Elements can be inserted and removed from one end (top)
* The top element is the one that was inserted most recently

**Operations**

* PUSH: inserting a new element into the stack
* POP: removing the top element from the stack
* TOP: accessing the top element of the stack
* SIZE: retrieving the number of elements in the stack

**Examples**

* A stack of books: inserting and removing books from the top
* A stack of balls in a can: inserting and removing balls from the top
* A stack of rings in a tower: inserting and removing rings from the top

**Terminologies**

* TOP: the top element of the stack
* PUSH: inserting a new element into the stack
* POP: removing the top element from the stack
* SIZE: retrieving the number of elements in the stack
* STACK OVERFLOW or FULL: when the stack is full and cannot accommodate more elements
* STACK UNDERFLOW or EMPTY: when the stack is empty and cannot remove elements

**Implementation**

* A variable called TOP is maintained to keep track of the top element
* PUSH operation inserts a new element into the stack
* POP operation removes the top element from the stack
* SIZE operation retrieves the number of elements in the stack

**Advantages**

* Efficient use of memory
* Easy to implement
* Can be used in various applications such as parsing, expression evaluation, and more

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, a stack is a fundamental data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It is a linear and homogeneous data structure that allows the insertion and removal of elements from one end. The key operations are PUSH, POP, and SIZE, and the variables TOP, PUSH, and POP are used to implement the stack. The advantages of using a stack include efficient use of memory and ease of implementation.

# PUSH-OPERATION

**Implementing a Stack Data Structure using Array**

**Introduction**

A stack is a fundamental data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It can be implemented using various data structures, including arrays and linked lists. In this discussion, we will focus on implementing a stack using an array.

**Assumptions**

1. The size of the array is fixed and cannot be changed at runtime.
2. The array is initialized with a lower bound of 0.
3. The stack is initially empty.
4. The `TOP` variable points to the index of the top element.
5. The `MAX` variable represents the maximum size of the array.

**Array Representation**

The array is represented by the `storage` variable, which is a global variable. The `TOP` variable is also a global variable that points to the index of the top element.

**Push Operation**

The push operation involves checking if there is enough space to accommodate a new element. The condition for checking is `TOP < MAX - 1`. If the condition is true, the element is inserted at the last position to reduce the time complexity.

**Example Code**

Here is an example of the push operation in Python:
```python
def push(element):
    if TOP < MAX - 1:
        TOP += 1
        storage[TOP] = element
    else:
        return -1  # Stack is full
```
**Time and Space Complexity**

The time complexity of the push operation is O(1) because it only involves a few operations. The space complexity is also O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of additional space.

**Conclusion**

In this discussion, we have implemented a stack data structure using an array. We have covered the assumptions, array representation, push operation, and time and space complexity. The push operation involves checking if there is enough space to accommodate a new element and inserting the element at the last position to reduce the time complexity.

# USING-HEADED-LINKED-LIST

**Implementing a Stack using Linked List**

**Introduction**

A stack is a data structure that follows a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where elements are added and removed from the top of the stack. In this transcript, we will explore how to implement a stack using a linked list data structure.

**Singly Linked List**

The transcript assumes the use of a singly linked list, where each node has a reference to the next node in the list. This simplifies the implementation of the stack operations.

**PUSH Operation**

The PUSH operation involves inserting a new node at the beginning of the list. The time complexity of this operation is O(1), as it only requires updating the head pointer and incrementing the node count.

**Example Code**
```python
def push(stack, value):
    new_node = Node(value)
    new_node.next = stack.head
    stack.head = new_node
    stack.count += 1
```
**POP Operation**

The POP operation involves removing the first node from the list. The time complexity of this operation is also O(1), as it only requires updating the head pointer and decrementing the node count.

**Example Code**
```python
def pop(stack):
    if stack.is_empty():
        return -1
    node = stack.head
    stack.head = node.next
    node.next = None
    stack.count -= 1
    return node.value
```
**IsEmpty Operation**

The IS_EMPTY operation checks if the stack is empty. The time complexity of this operation is O(1), as it only requires checking the node count.

**Example Code**
```python
def is_empty(stack):
    return stack.count == 0
```
**Size Operation**

The SIZE operation returns the number of nodes in the stack. The time complexity of this operation is O(1), as it only requires accessing the node count.

**Example Code**
```python
def size(stack):
    return stack.count
```
**Display Operation**

The DISPLAY operation prints all the elements in the stack. The time complexity of this operation is O(N), as it requires traversing the entire list.

**Example Code**
```python
def display(stack):
    current = stack.head
    while current:
        print(current.value)
        current = current.next
```
**Conclusion**

In this transcript, we explored how to implement a stack using a linked list data structure. We discussed the PUSH, POP, IS_EMPTY, SIZE, and DISPLAY operations, along with their time complexities. The implementation uses a singly linked list, which simplifies the stack operations.

# USING-NON-HEADED-LINKED-LIST

Introduction:
- The transcript discusses the implementation of a stack using a headless linked list, as opposed to a headed linked list. It covers the push and pop operations, as well as additional functions like isEmpty, size, and display.

Headless Linked List Implementation:
- In a headless linked list, there is no dummy node for the head, and the head pointer variable stores the address of the first node.
- The create operation involves declaring the head pointer variable.
- The push operation involves inserting a new node at the top of the stack and updating the head pointer to the new node's address.
- Example:
```python
def push(element):
    new_node = Node(element)
    new_node.next = head
    head = new_node
```

- The pop operation involves removing the first node from the stack and updating the head pointer to the next element.
- Example:
```python
def pop():
    if head is not None:
        temp = head
        ptr = head.next
        element = temp.data
        head = ptr
        del temp
        return element
    else:
        return -1  # indicating an empty stack
```

Additional Functions:
- The isEmpty function checks if the stack is empty by examining the value of the head pointer.
- The size function counts the number of nodes in the list by traversing the entire list.
- The display function traverses the entire list and displays its elements.
- Example:
```python
def isEmpty():
    return head is None

def size():
    count = 0
    current = head
    while current is not None:
        count += 1
        current = current.next
    return count

def display():
    current = head
    while current is not None:
        print(current.data)
        current = current.next
```

Summary:
- The headless linked list implementation of a stack involves manipulating the head pointer to perform push and pop operations.
- Additional functions like isEmpty, size, and display provide further functionality for the stack.
- The time and space complexities of each operation are also discussed, with push and pop operations having a time complexity of O(1) and space complexity of O(1). However, the size and display functions have a time complexity of O(n) due to traversing the entire list.

# ARITHMETIC-EXPRESSIONS

**Arithmetic Expressions and Conversions**

**Introduction**

Arithmetic expressions are a fundamental concept in programming and mathematics. In this note, we will discuss the three types of arithmetic expressions: infix, prefix, and postfix. We will also explore how to convert infix expressions to prefix and postfix expressions.

**Infix Expressions**

Infix expressions are the most common type of arithmetic expression. In an infix expression, the operator appears between the operands. For example, 2 + 3 or 4 * 5.

**Prefix Expressions**

Prefix expressions are a type of arithmetic expression where the operator appears before the operands. For example, +2 3 or *4 5.

**Postfix Expressions**

Postfix expressions are a type of arithmetic expression where the operator appears after the operands. For example, 2 + 3 or 4 * 5.

**Converting Infix to Prefix**

To convert an infix expression to a prefix expression, we need to follow these steps:

1. Apply parentheses to the expression based on its precedence and associativity.
2. Move the operator before the corresponding parenthesis.
3. Remove the parentheses to get the prefix expression.

For example, to convert the infix expression 2 + 3 * 4 to a prefix expression, we would apply parentheses to get (2 + 3) * 4, then move the operator before the parenthesis to get +(2 3) * 4, and finally remove the parentheses to get + 2 3 * 4.

**Converting Infix to Postfix**

To convert an infix expression to a postfix expression, we need to follow these steps:

1. Apply parentheses to the expression based on its precedence and associativity.
2. Move the operator after the corresponding closing parenthesis.
3. Remove the parentheses to get the postfix expression.

For example, to convert the infix expression 2 + 3 * 4 to a postfix expression, we would apply parentheses to get (2 + 3) * 4, then move the operator after the closing parenthesis to get 2 3 + * 4, and finally remove the parentheses to get 2 3 + * 4.

**Conclusion**

In this note, we discussed the three types of arithmetic expressions: infix, prefix, and postfix. We also explored how to convert infix expressions to prefix and postfix expressions. By following the steps outlined in this note, developers can convert infix expressions to prefix and postfix expressions using Python code.

# EVALUATION-OF-POSTFIX-EXPRESSION

- Introduction:
  - The transcript discusses the process of evaluating a postfix expression using a stack data structure.
  - It outlines the algorithm for scanning the postfix expression, performing operations, and the time and space complexity of the algorithm.

- Algorithm for Evaluating Postfix Expression:
  - Scanning the postfix expression:
    - The algorithm involves scanning the postfix expression from the first token to the last token.
  - Operand and Operator Handling:
    - If the token is an operand, it is pushed into the stack.
    - If the token is a binary operator, two operands are popped from the stack, the operator is applied to them, and the result is pushed back into the stack.
  - Example:
    - In an example provided, the infix expression "2 + 5 * 3 - 6 / 2" is converted to the postfix expression "2 5 3 * + 6 2 / -".
    - The algorithm is applied to evaluate the postfix expression step by step, demonstrating the process of pushing operands, popping operands for operators, and pushing results back into the stack.

- Time and Space Complexity:
  - Time Complexity:
    - The time complexity of the algorithm is order of n, where n is the number of tokens in the postfix expression.
    - This is due to the need to scan all the tokens, perform push and pop operations, and apply operators.
  - Space Complexity:
    - The space complexity is also order of n, limited by the number of tokens in the postfix expression.

- Summary:
  - The algorithm for evaluating a postfix expression using a stack involves scanning the expression, pushing operands, popping operands for operators, and pushing results back into the stack.
  - The time complexity is order of n, and the space complexity is also order of n.

By following the provided algorithm, the evaluation of postfix expressions using a stack can be efficiently performed, with a clear understanding of the time and space complexity involved.

# INFIX-TO-PREFIX-CONVERSION-USING-INFIX-TO-POSTFIX-CONVERTER

**Converting Infix to Prefix Expression**

**Introduction**

The process of converting an infix expression to its corresponding prefix expression involves reversing the input expression, converting the reversed infix to postfix, and then reversing the resulting postfix expression. This approach is based on the algorithm for converting infix to postfix, with some modifications.

**Step 1: Reverse the Infix Expression**

The first step is to reverse the infix expression. This involves scanning the expression from the last token to the first, replacing closing brackets with opening brackets and vice versa.

**Step 2: Convert Reverse Infix to Postfix**

The reversed infix expression is then converted to its corresponding postfix expression using the modified postfix conversion algorithm. The main difference between this algorithm and the standard one is that the condition for popping the stack has been modified to only pop the stack when the operator on top of the stack has higher precedence than the new token.

**Step 3: Reverse Postfix Expression**

The resulting postfix expression is then reversed to obtain the prefix expression.

**Example**

Consider the infix expression "a*b+c". The steps to convert it to its corresponding prefix expression are as follows:

1. Reverse the infix expression to obtain "c+a*b".
2. Convert the reversed infix to postfix using the modified algorithm.
3. Reverse the resulting postfix expression to obtain the prefix expression.

**Code Snippet**

Here is a Python code snippet illustrating the conversion process:
```python
def infix_to_prefix(infix):
    # Reverse the infix expression
    reversed_infix = infix[::-1]
    # Convert reversed infix to postfix using modified algorithm
    postfix = []
    stack = []
    for token in reversed_infix:
        if token.isalnum():
            postfix.append(token)
        elif token == '(':
            stack.append(token)
        elif token == ')':
            while stack and stack[-1] != '(':
                stack.pop()
            stack.pop()
        else:
            while stack and stack[-1] != '(' and precedence(token) <= precedence(stack[-1]):
                stack.pop()
            stack.append(token)
    # Reverse the postfix expression to obtain the prefix expression
    prefix = postfix[::-1]
    return prefix

def precedence(token):
    # Define precedence of operators
    if token == '+':
        return 1
    elif token == '-':
        return 1
    elif token == '*':
        return 2
    elif token == '/':
        return 2
    else:
        return 0

infix = "a*b+c"
prefix = infix_to_prefix(infix)
print(prefix)  # Output: "+*cab"
```
**Summary**

Converting an infix expression to its corresponding prefix expression involves reversing the input expression, converting the reversed infix to postfix using a modified algorithm, and then reversing the resulting postfix expression. The modified algorithm only pops the stack when the operator on top of the stack has higher precedence than the new token.
