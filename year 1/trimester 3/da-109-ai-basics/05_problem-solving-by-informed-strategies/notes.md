# INTRODUCTION

**Introduction**

This module focuses on informed strategies in problem-solving, building upon the uninformed strategies covered in the previous module. The main objective is to grasp the fundamentals of problem-solving using various informed strategies, including their advantages and limitations.

**Uninformed Strategies**

The module begins by reviewing the limitations of uninformed strategies, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS). These strategies are used to traverse a graph or tree, but they lack direction and often explore unnecessary paths.

**Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

BFS is a traversal algorithm that starts at the root node and explores all nodes at the current depth before moving to the next depth. It uses a queue data structure to keep track of nodes to visit. The algorithm expands the node with the lowest queue value first.

Example:
```
# Python code for BFS
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start):
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        print(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                queue.append(neighbor)
                visited.add(neighbor)

bfs({'A': ['B', 'C'], 'B': ['D', 'E'], 'C': ['F']}, 'A')
```
**Depth-First Search (DFS)**

DFS is a traversal algorithm that starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It uses a stack data structure to keep track of nodes to visit. The algorithm expands the node with the lowest stack value first.

Example:
```
# Python code for DFS
def dfs(graph, start):
    stack = [start]
    visited = set([start])
    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        print(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                stack.append(neighbor)
                visited.add(neighbor)

dfs({'A': ['B', 'C'], 'B': ['D', 'E'], 'C': ['F']}, 'A')
```
**Depth-Limited Search (DLS)**

DLS is a modification of DFS that limits the depth of the search. It sets a depth limit and explores nodes up to that depth before backtracking.

Example:
```
# Python code for DLS
def dls(graph, start, depth):
    stack = [(start, 0)]
    visited = set([start])
    while stack:
        node, depth_limit = stack.pop()
        print(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited and depth_limit > 0:
                stack.append((neighbor, depth_limit - 1))
                visited.add(neighbor)
        depth_limit -= 1

dls({'A': ['B', 'C'], 'B': ['D', 'E'], 'C': ['F']}, 'A', 2)
```
**Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)**

IDDFS is a combination of DLS and BFS. It starts with a depth limit of 0 and iteratively increases the depth limit until the goal is found.

Example:
```
# Python code for IDDFS
def iddfs(graph, start):
    depth = 0
    while True:
        stack = [(start, depth)]
        visited = set([start])
        while stack:
            node, depth_limit = stack.pop()
            print(node)
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    stack.append((neighbor, depth_limit - 1))
                    visited.add(neighbor)
            depth_limit -= 1
        if not stack:
            break
        depth += 1

iddfs({'A': ['B', 'C'], 'B': ['D', 'E'], 'C': ['F']}, 'A')
```
**Bidirectional Search**

Bidirectional search is a search algorithm that runs two simultaneous searches, one forward from the start state and one backward from the goal state. The searches meet in the middle, potentially reducing the search space and improving efficiency.

Example:
```
# Python code for bidirectional search
def bidirectional_search(graph, start, goal):
    # Forward search
    queue = [(start, 0)]
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        node, depth = queue.popleft()
        print(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                queue.append((neighbor, depth + 1))
                visited.add(neighbor)

    # Backward search
    queue = [(goal, 0)]
    visited = set([goal])
    while queue:
        node, depth = queue.popleft()
        print(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                queue.append((neighbor, depth + 1))
                visited.add(neighbor)

bidirectional_search({'A': ['B', 'C'], 'B': ['D', 'E'], 'C': ['F']}, 'A', 'F')
```
**Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**

UCS is a search algorithm that expands the node with the lowest cumulative cost first. It uses a priority queue data structure to keep track of nodes to visit.

Example:
```
# Python code for UCS
def ucs(graph, start, goal):
    queue = [(0, start)]
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        cost, node = heapq.heappop(queue)
        print(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                heapq.heappush(queue, (cost + 1, neighbor))
                visited.add(neighbor)

ucs({'A': ['B', 'C'], 'B': ['D', 'E'], 'C': ['F']}, 'A', 'F')
```
**Summary**

This module covered various informed strategies for problem-solving, including BFS, DFS, DLS, IDDFS, bidirectional search, and UCS. Each strategy has its advantages and limitations, and choosing the right strategy depends on the specific problem and constraints.

# LIMITATIONS-OF-UNINFORMED-STRATEGIES

**Limitations of Uninformed Search Strategies**

Uninformed search strategies, also known as blind search algorithms, lack domain-specific knowledge, which makes them inefficient and time-consuming. These strategies explore many irrelevant paths before finding the solution, leading to inefficiency.

**Lack of Efficiency**

Uninformed search strategies lack domain-specific knowledge, which means they do not have information to guide the search process towards more promising paths. This leads to exploring many irrelevant paths before finding the solution, making them inefficient.

**Example:** Consider a maze problem where the objective is to find the shortest path from the start node to the exit. A breadth-first search (BFS) will explore all possible paths by level, level by level. If the maze is large and complex, BFS will check many paths and lead to dead ends before finding the correct path to the exit.

**High Time Complexity**

Uninformed search strategies can be slow, especially when dealing with large search spaces. They often need to explore many nodes before finding a solution, resulting in a potentially long search time.

**Example:** Consider solving a complex puzzle like a 15-puzzle. A depth-first search (DFS) will explore each path to its fullest depth before backtracking. In a large puzzle, DFS may need to explore numerous configurations, which can be time-consuming.

**High Space Complexity**

Uninformed search strategies, like BFS, require significant memory to store all the nodes in the search tree. This high space complexity can quickly become impractical for large search problems.

**Example:** Consider finding the shortest path in a large social network graph where each node represents a person and each edge represents a friendship. BFS needs to keep track of all the nodes at the current level and all the nodes at the next level in a search tree. In a vast network, this means storing information about potentially millions of nodes simultaneously, leading to extremely high memory usage.

**Ineffectiveness with a Large Search Space**

Uninformed search strategies become increasingly impractical as the search space grows. They do not have a heuristic to prioritize the promising results, leading to exponential growth in both time and space requirements.

**Example:** Consider solving a large and complex Sudoku puzzle using DFS and an uninformed strategy. DFS will explore each possible number placement sequentially without any guidance on which placement are more likely to lead to a solution.

**No Guarantee of Optimality**

Some uninformed search strategies, like DFS, do not guarantee finding the shortest path or least cost solution. They may find a solution, but it might not be the most optimal one.

**Example:** Consider solving a maze problem where the objective is to find a shortest path from the start node to the exit. DFS may find a path to the exit relatively quickly, but there is no guarantee that this path is the shortest.

**Difficulty with Infinite Space**

Uninformed search strategies can get stuck in loops or continue indefinitely without finding an optimal solution when dealing with infinite search spaces.

**Example:** Consider a problem where DFS is used to find a path in an infinite grid where each cell is a state and moving up, left, or right constitutes an action. If the goal state is far from the start state, DFS may get stuck exploring the deep infinite path without ever backtracking to the goal.

**Resource Constraint**

Uninformed search strategies can be unsuitable for real-time or resource-constrained applications due to significant resource constraints like time and memory.

**Example:** Consider using BFS to find the shortest path in a large social network graph where each node represents a person and each edge represents a friendship. BFS must store all the nodes and their connections in memory, which can quickly become unmanageable as the number of users or nodes or friendships grows. Additionally, BFS will take considerable time to traverse a vast network, making it impractical for real-time applications.

**Summary**

Uninformed search strategies lack domain-specific knowledge, which makes them inefficient and time-consuming. They can be slow, require significant memory, and may not guarantee finding the shortest path or least cost solution. These limitations highlight the importance of using informed search strategies that incorporate domain-specific knowledge to guide the search process.

# INTRODUCTION-TO-INFORMED-STRATEGIES

**Informed Strategies and Heuristic Search**

The concept of informed strategies in artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science refers to the use of various search strategies that aim to solve problems more efficiently than traditional uninformed search strategies. Heuristic search is a type of informed strategy that uses domain-specific knowledge to guide the search process towards more promising areas of the search space.

**Domain-Specific Knowledge**

Domain-specific knowledge refers to the knowledge specific to a particular domain or field. In the context of heuristic search, domain-specific knowledge is used to guide the search process. For example, in the medical field, domain-specific knowledge includes medical history, symptoms, and diagnostic criteria. Similarly, in environmental monitoring, domain-specific knowledge includes environmental science, ecology, and regulatory frameworks.

**Heuristic Functions**

A heuristic function is a function that estimates the cost of the cheapest path from a state to the goal state. In other words, it is a function that estimates the distance from a given state to the goal state. The heuristic function is used to guide the search process towards more promising areas of the search space.

**Example: Heuristic Function in Romania**

In the example of finding the shortest path from one city to another in Romania, the heuristic function used is the straight-line distance. This means that the algorithm estimates the distance between two cities as the straight-line distance between them.

**Informed Search Algorithms**

Some examples of informed search algorithms include:

* Best-First Search (BFS)
* Greedy Search
* A\* Search

These algorithms use the heuristic function to guide the search process towards the goal state.

**Summary**

In this transcript, we discussed the concept of informed strategies in AI and computer science, including the use of heuristic search to solve problems more efficiently. We also discussed the importance of domain-specific knowledge and the use of heuristic functions to guide the search process. Examples were provided to illustrate key points, including the use of straight-line distance as a heuristic function in the example of finding the shortest path in Romania.

# GREEDY-BEST-FIRST-SEARCH

**Greedy Best-First Search Algorithm**

**Introduction**

The greedy best-first search algorithm is a type of best-first search technique that expands the node that is closest to the goal. It uses the heuristic function to evaluate the nodes, which is the distance from the current node to the goal node.

**How it Works**

The algorithm starts by evaluating the nodes using the heuristic function, which is the straight-line distance from the current node to the goal node. It then chooses the node with the minimum distance to the goal node and expands it. This process is repeated until the goal node is reached.

**Example**

Suppose we want to find the shortest path from Arad to Bucharest. We can use the greedy best-first search algorithm to find the path. The algorithm starts by evaluating the nodes using the heuristic function, which is the straight-line distance from the current node to the goal node. It then chooses the node with the minimum distance to the goal node and expands it. In this case, the algorithm chooses to expand the node Sibiu, which is the closest to the goal node Bucharest.

**Properties of Greedy Best-First Search**

* **Optimality**: The algorithm may not find the optimal path every time.
* **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the algorithm is O(b^m), where m is the maximum depth of the search tree.
* **Space Complexity**: The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the search tree.

**Limitations of Greedy Best-First Search**

* **Optimality**: The algorithm may not find the optimal path every time.
* **Infinite Loops**: The algorithm may get stuck in infinite loops if the heuristic function is not effective.

**Example of Greedy Best-First Search**

Suppose we want to find the shortest path from Arad to Bucharest. We can use the greedy best-first search algorithm to find the path. The algorithm starts by evaluating the nodes using the heuristic function, which is the straight-line distance from the current node to the goal node. It then chooses the node with the minimum distance to the goal node and expands it. In this case, the algorithm chooses to expand the node Sibiu, which is the closest to the goal node Bucharest. The algorithm then expands the node Fagaras, which is the closest to the goal node Bucharest. Finally, the algorithm reaches the goal node Bucharest.

**Conclusion**

The greedy best-first search algorithm is a type of best-first search technique that expands the node that is closest to the goal. It uses the heuristic function to evaluate the nodes, which is the distance from the current node to the goal node. The algorithm starts by evaluating the nodes using the heuristic function, which is the straight-line distance from the current node to the goal node. It then chooses the node with the minimum distance to the goal node and expands it. The algorithm may not find the optimal path every time, and it may get stuck in infinite loops if the heuristic function is not effective.

# GREEDY-BEST-FIRST-SEARCH-EXAMPLE

Here are the comprehensive notes based on the provided transcript:

**Introduction**

The transcript discusses the Greedy Best-First Search algorithm, a popular heuristic search algorithm used in many applications. The algorithm is designed to find the shortest path to the goal node by always choosing the node that seems closest to the goal according to the heuristic function.

**Greedy Best-First Search Algorithm**

The algorithm starts by defining a heuristic function, h(n), which estimates the straight-line distance from each node to the goal node. The function is used to guide the search towards the goal node.

**Example**

The transcript provides an example of the algorithm using the route problem. The algorithm is applied to a graph representing a route problem, where the goal is to find the shortest path from node A to node G. The algorithm starts by expanding node A, then node B, and so on, until the goal node G is reached.

**Advantages**

The Greedy Best-First Search algorithm has several advantages, including:

* It is faster than other search algorithms because it uses the heuristic function to guide the search.
* It is simple to implement and understand.
* It can potentially reduce the number of nodes expanded during the search.

**Disadvantages**

However, the algorithm also has some disadvantages, including:

* It is not guaranteed to find the optimal solution.
* It may lead to suboptimal paths.
* It may fail to find a solution if the heuristic function leads to dead ends or loops.

**Example Cont'd**

The transcript provides another example to illustrate the limitations of the algorithm. The example shows that the algorithm may not always find the optimal solution, even if it seems to be on the right path.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the Greedy Best-First Search algorithm is a powerful technique for finding the shortest path to the goal node. However, it relies heavily on the quality of the heuristic function, and it may not always find the optimal solution. Therefore, it is crucial to choose an appropriate heuristic function to guide the search effectively.

**Introduction**

The transcript discusses the A* search algorithm, a heuristic search algorithm that is widely used in many applications. The algorithm minimizes the total estimated solution cost by avoiding paths that are already expensive.

**Overview of A* Search**

The A* search algorithm is a heuristic search algorithm that uses an admissible heuristic function to guide the search towards the goal state. The algorithm uses the evaluation function f(n) = g(n) + h(n), where g(n) is the cost to reach the node n from the starting node and h(n) is the estimated cost to reach the goal from node n.

**Key Components of A* Search**

1. **Evaluation Function**: The evaluation function f(n) = g(n) + h(n) is used to guide the search towards the goal state.
2. **Admissible Heuristic**: The heuristic function h(n) is admissible if it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal state.
3. **Consistent Heuristic**: The heuristic function h(n) is consistent if for every node n and every successor n' of n, the estimated cost to reach the goal state from n' is no greater than the step cost to reach n' plus the estimated cost to reach the goal state from n.

**Properties of A* Search**

1. **Optimality**: A* search is optimal if the heuristic function is admissible and consistent.
2. **Completeness**: A* search is complete if it can find the goal state if it exists.
3. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of A* search is O(b^k), where b is the branching factor and k is the maximum depth of the search tree.
4. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity of A* search is O(b), where b is the branching factor.

**Example**

The example provided in the transcript illustrates the application of A* search to find the shortest path from Arad to Bucharest. The algorithm expands nodes based on the evaluation function f(n) = g(n) + h(n), where g(n) is the cost to reach the node n from the starting node and h(n) is the estimated cost to reach the goal state from node n. The algorithm uses the straight-line distance as the heuristic function h(n) to guide the search towards the goal state.

**Summary**

In conclusion, the A* search algorithm is a heuristic search algorithm that uses an admissible and consistent heuristic function to guide the search towards the goal state. The algorithm is optimal, complete, and has a time and space complexity of O(b^k) and O(b), respectively. The algorithm is widely used in many applications, including pathfinding in games and route planning in transportation systems.

# A-SEARCH-EXAMPLE

**Introduction**

The transcript discusses the A* search algorithm, a popular pathfinding technique used in many applications. The speaker explains the A* algorithm using the example of the eight puzzle problem, a classic problem in artificial intelligence.

**A* Search Algorithm**

The A* algorithm is a variant of the Dijkstra's algorithm that takes into account an admissible heuristic function to guide the search towards the goal state. The heuristic function used in this example is the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute differences between the current position and the goal position.

**Eight Puzzle Problem**

The eight puzzle problem is a classic problem in artificial intelligence where a 3x3 grid of tiles needs to be rearranged to form a goal state. The initial state is given as 2, 8, 3, 1, 6, 4, 7, 5, and the goal state is the solution 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

**A* Search Algorithm Example**

The speaker demonstrates the A* algorithm by applying it to the eight puzzle problem. The algorithm starts with the initial state and iteratively moves the blank space up, down, left, or right to find the goal state. The heuristic function is used to guide the search towards the goal state. The algorithm continues to expand the nodes with the lowest F value, which is the sum of the actual cost to reach the state and the heuristic value.

**Key Points**

* The A* algorithm is a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm that uses an admissible heuristic function to guide the search.
* The Manhattan distance is used as the heuristic function in this example.
* The A* algorithm starts with the initial state and iteratively moves the blank space up, down, left, or right to find the goal state.
* The algorithm continues to expand the nodes with the lowest F value, which is the sum of the actual cost to reach the state and the heuristic value.
* The A* algorithm efficiently finds the shortest sequence of moves to reach the goal state by combining the actual cost to reach the state with the admissible heuristic.

**Summary**

The A* algorithm is a powerful pathfinding technique that efficiently finds the shortest sequence of moves to reach the goal state by combining the actual cost to reach the state with the admissible heuristic. In the example of the eight puzzle problem, the A* algorithm uses the Manhattan distance as the heuristic function to guide the search towards the goal state. The algorithm iteratively moves the blank space up, down, left, or right to find the goal state, and continues to expand the nodes with the lowest F value.

# RECURSIVE-BEST-FIRST-SEARCH-EXAMPLE

**Recursive Best-First Search**

**Introduction**

Recursive Best-First Search (RBFS) is an optimal search algorithm that explores the best paths first. It is a variation of the Best-First Search algorithm that uses recursion to find the shortest path to the goal. RBFS is more efficient than other search algorithms in terms of memory usage.

**Key Points**

1. **Optimality**: RBFS is optimal in terms of memory usage and efficiency.
2. **Recursive Exploration**: RBFS recursively explores the best paths first, exploring the most promising nodes first.
3. **Heuristic Function**: The heuristic function (h(n)) is used to guide the search towards the goal.
4. **Cost Calculation**: The cost of each node is calculated using the formula: g(n) = g(parent) + c, where g(n) is the cost of reaching node n, g(parent) is the cost of reaching the parent node, and c is the cost of moving from the parent node to node n.
5. **Backtracking**: If the path does not lead to the goal or exceeds the cost limit, the algorithm backtracks and tries the next best path.
6. **Example**: An example is provided to illustrate the RBFS algorithm. The example shows how the algorithm explores the best paths first and backtracks when necessary.

**Example**

Here is an example of how the RBFS algorithm works:

Suppose we have a graph with nodes S, A, B, C, D, E, and F. The heuristic function h(n) is defined as follows:

* S = 7
* A = 6
* B = 4
* C = 5
* D = 3
* E = 2
* F = 3

The algorithm starts at node S and explores the best path first. The algorithm calculates the cost of each node using the formula: g(n) = g(parent) + c. The algorithm backtracks when necessary and tries the next best path.

**Summary**

In summary, the Recursive Best-First Search algorithm is an optimal search algorithm that explores the best paths first. It uses the heuristic function to guide the search towards the goal and backtracks when necessary. The algorithm is more efficient than other search algorithms in terms of memory usage and efficiency.

# SIGNIFICANCE-OF-HEURISTIC-FUNCTIONS-1

**Heuristic Search and Branching Factor**

**Introduction**

Heuristic search is a type of search algorithm that uses heuristics to guide the search towards the goal state. The heuristic function is used to estimate the distance from the current state to the goal state. The branching factor is a critical factor in determining the efficiency of the heuristic search.

**What is the Branching Factor?**

The branching factor is the average number of child nodes generated from each node in the search tree. It is calculated by considering the average number of child nodes generated from each node in the search tree.

**Examples of Branching Factor**

* In the 8-puzzle problem, the branching factor is 2-4, indicating that each node may have 2-4 child nodes.
* In the root finding problem, the branching factor is the average number of roads leading out from an intersection.

**Impact of Branching Factor on Time Complexity**

The time complexity of a search algorithm is often dependent on the branching factor. As the branching factor increases, the time complexity also increases exponentially.

**Impact of Branching Factor on Space Complexity**

The space complexity of a search algorithm is also affected by the branching factor. As the branching factor increases, the memory required to store the nodes also increases exponentially.

**Importance of Branching Factor**

The branching factor is a critical factor in determining the efficiency of the heuristic search. A lower branching factor leads to more efficient search algorithms.

**Examples of Heuristic Search**

* A* search algorithm uses a heuristic function to guide the search towards the goal state.
* The Manhattan distance is a commonly used heuristic function.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the branching factor is a critical factor in determining the efficiency of the heuristic search. Understanding the branching factor is essential for designing efficient search algorithms.

# SIGNIFICANCE-OF-HEURISTIC-FUNCTIONS-2

**Module 5: Informed Strategies**

**Introduction**

Informed strategies in problem-solving involve using knowledge from the problem itself to guide the search for a solution. This approach is in contrast to uninformed strategies, which rely solely on the structure of the problem. Informed strategies use heuristics, which are rules of thumb that guide the search towards a solution.

**What is a Heuristic?**

A heuristic is a function that estimates the cost of reaching the goal from a given state. It is used to guide the search towards a solution. In other words, it helps the search algorithm decide which path to take next.

**Types of Heuristics**

There are two main types of heuristics: admissible heuristics and inadmissible heuristics. Admissible heuristics never overestimate the true cost to reach the goal, while inadmissible heuristics may overestimate or underestimate the true cost.

**Generating Admissible Heuristics**

To generate an admissible heuristic, you can relax the problem and solve the relaxed problem to get a heuristic function. For example, in the 8-puzzle, you can relax the problem by allowing tiles to move anywhere and calculate the sum of the Manhattan distances from each tile to its goal position.

**Learning Heuristics from Experience**

Learning heuristics from experience involves using historical data and outcomes to improve the guidance of the search algorithm. This can be done through reinforcement learning, supervised learning, or case-based reasoning.

**Benefits of Learning Heuristics**

The benefits of learning heuristics from experience include improved efficiency, adaptability, and enhanced performance.

**Challenges**

Some challenges associated with learning heuristics from experience include data quality, overfitting, and computational cost.

**Informed Search Algorithms**

Some examples of informed search algorithms include:

1. **Greedy Best-First Search**: This algorithm uses a heuristic function to guide the search towards the goal.
2. **A\* Search**: This algorithm combines the heuristic function with the cost of reaching the current node to guide the search.

**Conclusion**

Informed strategies in problem-solving involve using knowledge from the problem itself to guide the search for a solution. Heuristics are used to guide the search, and learning heuristics from experience can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the search algorithm.
